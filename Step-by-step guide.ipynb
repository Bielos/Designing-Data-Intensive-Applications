    "## Step 1: Big picture of components (See chapter 1)\n",
    "The first step in designing a data-intensive application is to broadly identify the components that will come into play. You can ask yourself questions like:\n",
    "* How big is my data?\n",
    "* How complex is it?\n",
    "* How fast doest it change?\n",
    "* Does it need caching processes?\n",
    "* Does it need to allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (search indexes)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to clarify a broad picture of the components that are needed in the architecture, and then go deeper into each component by selecting the technology that best fits the overall need of the application.\n",

    "* If the system grows in a particular way, what are our options for coping with the growth?\n",
